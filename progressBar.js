/* 
Total points = 100%
Each goal will have different amount of tasks, so divide total points by total task
and you get the value for each task.

Total points/num of tasks = point value per task
(point value of task/total points) * 100 = percent value per task

if 0 tasks are completed --> no progress on task bar
